The three companies: Yellow, Blue, and Red are assigned three routes as shown in the Site Selection section. The aim is to find elevations at 20 feet interval along the routes. In addition, the companies are required to use at least one turning point (TP) along the designated routes. The BM information is provided in the Site Selection section. The deliverables from each of these companies are:\r\nA final Presentation including:\r\ndetail methodology of data collection\r\nsummary of the topography of the routes\r\n\r\nA final report:\r\nonly providing a detailed engineering drawing of the profile along the route\r\n\r\nPROJECT TASKS:\r\n1.

Data Collection and Data Analysis (50%)\r\nTo collect data, schedule a time to reserve equipment via email: ahmedf@email.sc.edu Your email should include the following information:\r\nprovide a list of equipment you need\r\nindicate when are you going to pick up equipment\r\nindicate when are you planning to do the project work\r\nindicated when are you going to return the equipment\r\n\r\nPrepare a data form. The data form will be similar to lab session related to contouring\r\n5. Presentation and Submission (30%)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The map\r\nshows the intersections of interest.\r\nProject SiteOur subcontract stipulates that we will provide technical memoranda.\r\nThe tech memo should provide the following information.\r\nReconnaissance: CAD‐drawn (AutoCAD or\r\nMicroStation or other suitable soft) plan view of the assigned\r\nintersection showing:\r\nCurb‐to‐curb dimensions of all approaches (units should be in\r\nfeet and inches.\r\nLane and channelization markings.\r\nTraffic control at the intersection\r\n\r\nData Collection:\r\nTraffic volume counts during should be done in peak traffic periods.\r\nGroup BLUE : Collect data for Morning Peak\r\n(7.30-9.30AM)\r\nGroup RED : Collect data for Evening peak\r\n(4.30-6.30AM)\r\n\r\nVolumes showing numbers of cars, trucks, and buses making through,\r\nleft, and right turn movements Volumes should be recorded for each\r\n15‐minute interval during each hour.\r\nTraffic counts should be collected on a “typical” day; thus, they\r\nshould be done on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Avoid doing\r\ntraffic counts on Mondays and Fridays. A traffic count template is\r\nprovided in the TMC lab session.\r\n\r\nCapacity analyses:\r\nPresent level of service (LOS) for existing traffic condition and\r\ntraffic control using HCS 2010 and Synchro. Compare results (e.g.,\r\ndelay) from both software.\r\nAnalyze the LOS in Synchro if traffic control at the intersection\r\nis (i) TWSC and (ii) Roundabout\r\nDiscuss the following:\r\nWhat is the best traffic control for the intersection and\r\nwhy?\r\nDescribe any bicycle or pedestrian issues that you believe are\r\nproblematic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tech memo should be brief, but must contain sufficient text to\r\nclearly explain and convey to the reader the information it\r\ncontains.\r\nTech memo is due from each team on TBA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

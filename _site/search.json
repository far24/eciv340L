The three companies: Yellow, Blue, and Red are assigned three routes as shown in the Site Selection section. The aim is to find elevations at 20 feet interval along the routes. In addition, the companies are required to use at least one turning point (TP) along the designated routes. The BM information is provided in the Site Selection section. The deliverables from each of these companies are:\r\nA final Presentation including:\r\ndetail methodology of data collection\r\nsummary of the topography of the routes\r\n\r\nA final report:\r\nonly providing a detailed engineering drawing of the profile along the route\r\n\r\nPROJECT TASKS:\r\n1.

Data Collection and Data Analysis (50%)\r\nTo collect data, schedule a time to reserve equipment via email: ahmedf@email.sc.edu Your email should include the following information:\r\nprovide a list of equipment you need\r\nindicate when are you going to pick up equipment\r\nindicate when are you planning to do the project work\r\nindicated when are you going to return the equipment\r\n\r\nPrepare a data form. The data form will be similar to lab session related to contouring\r\n5. Presentation and Submission (30%)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

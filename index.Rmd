# Course Description
This course aims to provide students with sound data collection and analysis techniques.  This course is intended to complement the materials covered in Introduction to Transportation Engineering (ECIV 340), with emphasis on field experience.

# Learning Outcomes
At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:  

1.	Collect necessary traffic data to support traffic impact studies and transportation planning studies.  

2.	Make field book entry and perform engineering calculations in proper format using self-measured data.  

3.	Write engineering reports.

## Prerequisites/Co-Requisites  
Students must either have previously completed ECIV 340 or take ECIV 340 in the same semester as this course (ECIV 340L).  Students are expected to be proficient with Microsoft Excel. The prerequisite for the class are ECIV  101 and STAT 509.

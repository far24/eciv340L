## ECIV 340L Project (FALL 2022)

We have been retained by a civil engineering firm, Columbia, LLC, to
conduct a traffic analysis of individual intersections in proximity of
department of CEE at the University of South Carolina (UofSC). The map
shows the intersections of interest.

Our subcontract stipulates that we will provide technical memoranda. The
tech memo should provide the following information.

1.  **Reconnaissance:** CAD‐drawn (AutoCAD or MicroStation or other
    suitable soft) plan view of the assigned intersection showing:

    a.  Curb‐to‐curb dimensions of all approaches (units should be in
        feet and inches.

    b.  Lane and channelization markings.

    c.  Traffic control at the intersection

2.  **Data Collection:**

    a.  Traffic volume counts during should be done in peak traffic
        periods.
        -   **Group 1 : Collect data on typical day for Morning Peak (7.30-9.30AM)**
        -   **Group 2 : Collect data for on typical day Evening peak (4.30-6.30AM)**
        -   **Group 3 : Collect data for on non-typical day Morning Peak (7.30-9.30AM)or Evening peak (4.30-6.30AM)**
    b.  Volumes showing numbers of cars, trucks, and buses making
        through, left, and right turn movements Volumes should be
        recorded for each 15‐minute interval during each hour.
    c.  Traffic counts should be collected on a "typical" day; thus,
        they should be done on **Tuesdays, Wednesdays**. A traffic
        count template is provided in the TMC lab session.

3.  **Capacity analyses**:

    a.  Present level of service (LOS) for existing traffic condition
        and traffic control using HCS 07 or HCS 2010 or Synchro.

    b.  Analyze the LOS in HCS 07 or HCS 2010 or Synchro if traffic control at the
        intersection is (i) AWSC (existing condition) and (ii) TWSC (Previous condition). **Compare your results**.

    c.  Discuss the following:

        1.  What is the best traffic control for the intersection and
            why?  Would you suggest a different intersection control other than AWSC or TWSC?
            

        2.  Describe any bicycle or pedestrian issues that you believe
            are problematic.

The tech memo should be brief, but must contain sufficient text to
clearly explain and convey to the reader the information it contains.

Tech memo is due from each team on **NOV 18, 2022**.
